## About Partybaby

Partybaby is a modern theme built with a **HTML-first, JavaScript-only-as-needed** approach to theme development. It integrates performance, flexibility, and the latest features out of the box and serves as a reference for building custom Shopify themes.

Key principles of Partybaby:

- **Web-native approach:** Leverages the latest web browsers to their fullest while ensuring compatibility with older ones via progressive enhancement.
- **Lean, fast, and reliable:** Features are added only if they are essential, with a focus on code quality and purpose.
- **Server-rendered HTML:** HTML is rendered by Shopify servers using Liquid. Client-side rendering is minimized to enhance performance.
- **Functional over pixel-perfect:** The theme emphasizes functionality across browsers, ensuring a smooth experience regardless of the rendering engine.

## Developer Tools
Partybaby is set up to work with a variety of useful developer tools.

### Shopify CLI

[Shopify CLI](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-cli) helps automate and enhance your local development workflow. It includes commands for creating, updating, and managing Shopify themes, along with a development server for local testing.
